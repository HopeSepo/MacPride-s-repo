from this lab i learnt more basic git commands in the terminal and i also learnt alot from modifying an html file, to adding, commiting changes and push to the branch. I also learnt how to create a new branch from githud and not from the terminal. Not only that but i aslo learnt about how live server works in vs code and lastly but not list i larnt more on pulling a request and merging branches.
